# coupled-kinetic-spheres
A 1D simulation of two spheres, each oscillating within a harmonic spring potential whilst experiencing Brownian motion, hydrodynamic coupling and kinetic switching

Run the simulation with ```python coupled.py``` using parameters from ```Params.py``` (defaults to uncoupled Brownian motion with no switching)

Plot results with ```python plot.py```

View the animated trajectory with ```python animate.py```
